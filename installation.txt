To restart jira:

Navigate to the sub-directory where the batch file "Start-jira.bat" is located, e.g.
go to command terminal C:\Users\jansr\Atlassian\Jira\bin

Once in that sub-directory type Start-jira.bat /fg and press ENTER, to load your local host 8080

Cucumber:
right click on project -> configure -> convert to cucumber project.
Benefit of doing this: On click control+space on any feature steps, it directs to respective step definition.
If tidy gherkin is deprecated or not allowed in project, just create feature and runner file, run the junit, console will display the step definition. just copy and paste.

To run using Junit without any issues:

Right click on project in eclipse->properties->java build path-> check if a separate maven folder is present. By default it wont. but if so delete it as rahulshetty did. Else, two junits may create issues.
